# 03 - Searching For Exploits With SearchSploit

Note: No transcript was provided. The following summary and commands are inferred conservatively from the filename/context and standard eJPT workflows for using SearchSploit (Exploit‑DB’s offline CLI).

## What the video covers (Introduction / big picture)
- How to quickly find relevant public exploits and PoCs for discovered services/versions using SearchSploit (the Exploit‑DB CLI).
- How to narrow results, read exploit details, copy PoCs locally, and map Nmap scan results to potential exploits.
- Practical usage of key flags: update, title-only search, print path, view/examine, mirror to working directory, and Nmap XML integration.

## Flow (ordered)
1. Perform service/version discovery (e.g., with Nmap -sV).
2. Update the local Exploit‑DB index.
3. Search by product and version; refine via title-only search to reduce noise.
4. Review results; prefer exact version matches or close variants.
5. Use EDB-ID to inspect the exploit’s details and path.
6. Mirror (copy) the PoC into your working directory.
7. If needed, open the Exploit‑DB page in a browser for more context.
8. Optionally, feed Nmap XML to SearchSploit to auto-suggest related exploits.
9. Follow exploit usage notes (language, dependencies, compile/run) as indicated by the PoC.

## Tools highlighted
- SearchSploit (Exploit‑DB CLI) on Kali/Parrot: /usr/bin/searchsploit
- Exploit‑DB local repo: /usr/share/exploitdb
- Nmap (for -sV detection and XML export)
- less/cat/grep (review and filter results)

## Typical command walkthrough (detailed, copy-paste friendly)

Update your local Exploit‑DB index:
```bash
searchsploit -u
```

Basic search by product and version:
```bash
# General search (product + version)
searchsploit apache 2.4.49

# Title-only search (less noise)
searchsploit -t "apache 2.4.49"

# Include URLs to Exploit-DB pages (handy for browser)
searchsploit -w -t "apache 2.4.49"
```

Filter large result sets:
```bash
# Pipe to grep to focus on likely matches
searchsploit samba | grep -i "3\.0\.20"
```

Inspect a specific exploit by EDB-ID:
```bash
# Show the full local path to the exploit/PoC
searchsploit -p 17491

# Examine (open with less) to read usage, notes, references
searchsploit -x 17491
```

Copy (mirror) a PoC into your current working directory:
```bash
# Copies the PoC/exploit locally (preserves original in /usr/share/exploitdb)
searchsploit -m 17491

# Then view it
ls -l
less 17491.*
```

Open the Exploit‑DB page (replace with your EDB-ID):
```bash
xdg-open "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/17491"
```

Tie Nmap results to exploits:
```bash
# 1) Scan and save to XML
nmap -sV -oX nmap.xml 10.10.10.10

# 2) Feed to SearchSploit to auto-search each discovered service/version
searchsploit --nmap nmap.xml

# Optionally include URLs
searchsploit -w --nmap nmap.xml
```

Example end-to-end (vsftpd 2.3.4):
```bash
# Update DB
searchsploit -u

# Search
searchsploit -t "vsftpd 2.3.4"

# Inspect a likely hit (e.g., EDB-ID 17491 for the backdoor RCE)
searchsploit -x 17491

# Copy to current directory
searchsploit -m 17491

# Read usage notes
less 17491.*
```

Notes:
- After mirroring a PoC, follow its usage instructions (e.g., python3 exploit.py args, gcc filename.c -o exploit, ruby, etc.).
- Use quotes around multiword searches for cleaner matching.

## Practical tips
- Be version-specific first; then expand (e.g., try “2.4.49”, then “2.4.x”, then just product name).
- Use -t (title-only) to reduce noise; add -w to get clickable URLs.
- Prefer exploits that match OS and architecture; check the path categories (unix/windows/webapps/local/remote/dos).
- Always read the PoC header for requirements and safe usage; many include compilation flags, dependencies, or target constraints.
- Use Nmap XML integration early; it’s a fast way to surface candidates across all detected services.
- If you see too many DoS results, refine terms (e.g., add “remote” or the CVE).
- Validate exploit reliability in a lab before using on a real target; some PoCs are unstable or require tweaks.
- Keep your local DB current (searchsploit -u), especially in exam/lab contexts.

## Minimal cheat sheet (one-screen flow)
```bash
# Update DB
searchsploit -u

# Search (product + version)
searchsploit -t "product version"
searchsploit -w -t "product version"     # show URLs

# Filter noisy output
searchsploit product | grep -i "version"

# Inspect and copy by EDB-ID
searchsploit -x EDB-ID                    # read exploit
searchsploit -p EDB-ID                    # show path
searchsploit -m EDB-ID                    # copy PoC here

# Nmap integration
nmap -sV -oX nmap.xml TARGET
searchsploit --nmap nmap.xml
searchsploit -w --nmap nmap.xml
```

## Summary
This video demonstrates how to use SearchSploit to rapidly map discovered services/versions to known public exploits from Exploit‑DB. The core workflow: update the DB, search with version-specific queries (prefer title-only), review and inspect promising PoCs by EDB-ID, mirror them locally, and optionally leverage Nmap XML integration to automate searches from your scan results. This approach streamlines the exploit discovery phase of your eJPT methodology.
